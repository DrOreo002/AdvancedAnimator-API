# AdvancedAnimator-API
An public API documentation source for my premium plugin (Not yet uploaded)

# Information
This is not itended to be buildable, I'm making it as a repository because I'm to lazy to make my own Wiki
so why don't I just add the documentation inside the code instead?, it much more easier I believe. So yea I made this
and I don't really need wiki anymore, you can just see the code and I'm 100% sure you'll understand

# Issue Report
I'm not going to disable the Issue tab, so feel free to ask for help if you need any or report an bug/glich/issue from the plugin!.
That will sure help the plugin to be better!

# Pull Request
The pull request is open and I'll prob going to accept some of ur PR(s) if only that PR is useful for me
and for the plugin (e.g, updating the java docs, or updating the code)

# And...
I'm planning on making this project open source in the future, after I got like 100 or 200 buyers. This is just a plan and I'm not sure if I'm going to do it or not. Just wait for it :D
